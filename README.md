# bin-fill-level-monitoring-system
this project enables real-time monitoring of trash levels within a bin. The ultrasonic sensor accurately measures the distance to the surface of the waste, while the Arduino processes this data to calculate the fill level as a percentage of the bin's capacity. Users can conveniently monitor the fill.
