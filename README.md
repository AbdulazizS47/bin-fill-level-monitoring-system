This model project leverages the power of Arduino and ultrasonic distance sensing technology to create a modern solution for efficient waste management.

At its core, the Smart Trash Bin utilizes an Arduino microcontroller to process data from an ultrasonic distance sensor. This sensor accurately measures the distance to the surface of the trash, enabling the system to calculate the fill level of the bin in real time. The data is then displayed on a LiquidCrystal I2C Display, providing users with clear and concise information about the current fill level.

With its intuitive interface and smart alerts, the Smart Trash Bin project offers a seamless user experience, ensuring timely notifications when the bin reaches capacity. Whether you're seeking to optimize waste collection processes at home, in the office, or in public spaces, this project exemplifies the potential of technology to revolutionize traditional tasks and enhance efficiency.

Explore the code, documentation, and schematics in this repository to learn more about how you can build your own Smart Trash Bin and contribute to the future of sustainable waste management. Join us in transforming the way we handle waste, one bin at a time!
